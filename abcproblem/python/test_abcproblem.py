# plan:
# can_make_word(word) -
#   check for any issues w/ word (optional)
#   call get_needed_pairs w/ get_needed_pairs
#   get_needed_pairs(word) -
#       find every pair that has a letter in the word
#   sort by least used letter
#       This is done to lower the chance that a word cannot be reconstructed because
#       a needed letter is taken by a more common letter,
#       ex: WALL -- ("L", "A"), ("L", "C"), ("W", "D"), ("Q", "L")
#                   L      A      L           W                L
#                   You can make WALL with these letters, but if you use the L from the ("L", "A") pair, you cannot.
#       -- This is not perfect, perhaps there's a better way to do this?
#   remove needed pairs until word is reconstructed
#   check if word reconstructed successfully
